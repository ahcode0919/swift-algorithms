# Swift Algorithms [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ahcode0919/swift-ds-algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ahcode0919/swift-ds-algorithms)

Repository of solutions to various problems and algorithms in Swift. Many
problems have multiple common approaches presented. With some being more efficient than
others. Xcode Project contains performance tests for those that are curious.
